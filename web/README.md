# web/ — Blueprints Talk demo

Ask a question about a drawing or an IFC model. The answer card shows the value, confidence, cost, the
reasoning steps, assumptions, what is missing, and the evidence list. The evidence is drawn on the 2D
sheet (PDF.js / image) and highlighted in the 3D IFC model (web-ifc + three.js). For `ifc_models` sheets,
both views are linked through IFC GlobalIds: click a room or door on the drawing to see it in 3D, and the
other way round.

## Run

```bash
cd web
npm install
npm run dev          # http://localhost:5173 (Vite, port 5173)
```

- `STOA_DATA` must point at the dataset root (default: the team path in `AGENTS.md`).
- `/api/*` goes to W4's API (`STOA_API_URL`, default `http://127.0.0.1:8100`, see `docs/CONTRACT.md`).
  If that server is down, the dev server answers from a **mock** (`mock/stoaApi.ts`): files and example
  questions come from the dataset, `/ask` returns the precomputed fixtures in `fixtures/answers.json`. The
  badge in the top-left says `API live` or `API mock`.
- `npm run build` type-checks and builds to `dist/`. `npm run preview` serves the build with the same
  `/api` middleware (no separate server needed).

Deep links: `/?file=<dataset-relative path>&q=<question>` opens a file and asks right away, e.g.
`/?file=data/ifc_models/bsc-esplanades_1807-ep-ar-v18_plan-01-1-korrus.pdf&q=How many doors are shown on the floor plan of '1.korrus'?`

## Demo script (30 s)

1. `bsc-esplanades … plan-01-1-korrus.pdf` → "What is the net floor area of the room 'KORIDOR (119)' …?"
   → 63.84 m², the corridor outline on the plan and its volume in 3D, cross-check against the IFC property.
2. Same sheet → "How many doors are shown on the floor plan of '1.korrus'?" → 46 boxes on the plan, 46 doors
   lit in 3D, "plan 46 = IFC storey 46 ✓". Click item 8 in the evidence list: both views zoom to that door.
3. `site1000_bldg2082_floor9385.pdf` → "How many rooms labelled 'Zimmer' …?" → 12 boxes, DXF cross-check.
4. `A-801 … Schedules.pdf` (sheet rotated 90°) → room 128 area → the schedule cell is boxed.

## Fixtures

`fixtures/make_fixtures.py` computes the demo answers the way a deterministic solver would (PDF text layer,
the IfcConvert `.svg` sibling's GUID groups, IfcOpenShell, DXF layers). It never reads the gold answers. All
five match the dataset answers. Regenerate:

```bash
$JUNCTION_VENV/bin/python web/fixtures/make_fixtures.py
```

## Coordinates (docs/CONTRACT.md)

- `pdf_pt`: PyMuPDF's **unrotated** page space (origin top-left, y down). On a sheet with `/Rotate 90`,
  `page.rect` is rotated but `search_for`/`get_text` boxes are not; the viewer maps
  `(x, y) → (x + view[0], view[3] − y)` into PDF user space and lets the PDF.js viewport apply the rotation.
- `image_px`: pixels of the stored image.
- `ifc_models` sheet SVG → PDF: `pdf_pt = (svg − viewBox origin) × 72/25.4`.

## Code

| File | What |
|---|---|
| `src/main.ts` | state, file picker, ask flow, view modes (drawing / 3D / side by side), deep links |
| `src/viewer2d.ts` | PDF.js / image rendering, evidence overlay, GUID layer from the sheet SVG, pan/zoom |
| `src/viewer3d.ts` | web-ifc → merged three.js meshes per storey; storey filter, highlight/frame by GlobalId, picking |
| `src/card.ts` | answer card (value, confidence, cross-check badge, cost tier/time/tokens/€, trace, evidence) |
| `mock/stoaApi.ts` | `/api/*` middleware: forwards to :8100, falls back to the mock |
